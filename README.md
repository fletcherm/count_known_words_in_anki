count_known_words_in_anki
=========================

A script for counting notes in Anki.

Note: This script is highly personalized for myself and my own Anki database and will not work for anyone else straight-up. I hope it is still a helpful reference.

Thank you *so much* to Shawn Moore ([sartak](https://github.com/sartak)) for documenting [Anki's database schema](https://gist.github.com/sartak/3921255)!
