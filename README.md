count_known_words_in_anki
=========================

Matt's scripts for mining some interesting data from my Anki database.

Note: These scripts are highly personalized for myself and my own Anki database. It will not work for anyone else as-is. I hope it is still a helpful reference.

Thank you *so much* to Shawn Moore ([sartak](https://github.com/sartak)) for documenting [Anki's database schema](https://gist.github.com/sartak/3921255)!

Scripts in the bin directory:
* count_known_words - Tells me about how many French words I know.
* group_words_reviewed_today - Creates several groups of random words I reviewed today. I use it to help come up with things to post about on [lang-8](http://lang-8.com/).
